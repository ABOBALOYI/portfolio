As a penetration tester, having a systematic methodology is crucial for thorough and consistent security assessments. Here's my proven approach that I've refined through years of testing various environments.

## üéØ Phase 1: Pre-Engagement

Before any testing begins, proper scoping and authorization are essential:

### Legal Documentation

- **Signed Statement of Work (SOW)**
- **Rules of Engagement (RoE)**
- **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**
- **Authorization letters** from system owners

### Scope Definition

- **Target systems and networks**
- **Testing timeframes**
- **Allowed testing methods**
- **Emergency contacts**

## üîç Phase 2: Information Gathering & Reconnaissance

This phase involves collecting as much information as possible about the target:

### Passive Reconnaissance

```bash
# Domain enumeration
whois target.com
dig target.com ANY
nslookup target.com

# Subdomain discovery
subfinder -d target.com
amass enum -d target.com
```

### Active Reconnaissance

```bash
# Network scanning
nmap -sS -A -T4 target.com
nmap -sU --top-ports 1000 target.com

# Service enumeration
nmap -sC -sV -p- target.com
```

### OSINT Gathering

- **Social media profiling**
- **Employee information** (LinkedIn, company websites)
- **Technology stack identification**
- **Leaked credentials** (Have I Been Pwned, breach databases)

## üõ°Ô∏è Phase 3: Vulnerability Assessment

Systematic identification of security weaknesses:

### Automated Scanning

```bash
# Web application scanning
nikto -h https://target.com
dirb https://target.com /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

# Vulnerability scanning
nessus_scan target.com
openvas_scan target.com
```

### Manual Testing

- **OWASP Top 10 testing**
- **Business logic flaws**
- **Authentication bypass**
- **Authorization issues**

## ‚öîÔ∏è Phase 4: Exploitation

Attempting to exploit identified vulnerabilities:

### Web Application Exploitation

```bash
# SQL Injection
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/page?id=1" --dbs

# XSS Testing
# Manual payload testing and validation
```

### Network Exploitation

```bash
# Metasploit framework
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue
set RHOSTS target_ip
exploit
```

### Post-Exploitation

- **Privilege escalation**
- **Lateral movement**
- **Data exfiltration simulation**
- **Persistence mechanisms**

## üìä Phase 5: Reporting & Remediation

Comprehensive documentation of findings:

### Executive Summary

- **Risk overview**
- **Business impact**
- **High-level recommendations**

### Technical Details

- **Vulnerability descriptions**
- **Proof of concept**
- **CVSS scoring**
- **Remediation steps**

### Risk Rating Matrix

| Severity | CVSS Score | Business Impact                         |
| -------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Critical | 9.0-10.0   | Immediate threat to business operations |
| High     | 7.0-8.9    | Significant security risk               |
| Medium   | 4.0-6.9    | Moderate security concern               |
| Low      | 0.1-3.9    | Minor security issue                    |

## üîß Tools I Use

### Reconnaissance

- **Nmap** - Network discovery and security auditing
- **Subfinder** - Subdomain discovery
- **Amass** - Attack surface mapping

### Web Application Testing

- **Burp Suite Professional** - Web vulnerability scanner
- **OWASP ZAP** - Security testing proxy
- **SQLmap** - Automatic SQL injection tool

### Network Testing

- **Metasploit** - Penetration testing framework
- **Nessus** - Vulnerability scanner
- **Wireshark** - Network protocol analyzer

### Custom Scripts

```python
# Example: Custom subdomain enumeration
import requests
import threading

def check_subdomain(subdomain, domain):
    url = f"http://{subdomain}.{domain}"
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"[+] Found: {url}")
    except:
        pass

```

## üéì Continuous Learning

The cybersecurity landscape evolves rapidly. I stay current through:

- **CVE monitoring** and vulnerability research
- **Security conferences** (DEF CON, Black Hat, BSides)
- **Capture The Flag (CTF)** competitions
- **Bug bounty programs**
- **Security certifications** (OSCP, CEH, CISSP)

## üîí Ethical Considerations

Remember that penetration testing must always be:

- **Authorized** by proper stakeholders
- **Scoped** to agreed-upon targets
- **Professional** in approach and reporting
- **Confidential** regarding client information

This methodology has served me well across various industries and environments. The key is adapting it to each unique engagement while maintaining thoroughness and professionalism.
