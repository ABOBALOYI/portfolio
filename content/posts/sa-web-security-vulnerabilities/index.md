As a penetration tester working with South African businesses, I've noticed recurring security vulnerabilities that put companies at serious risk. Here are the top 5 issues I consistently find—and more importantly, how to fix them.

## 1. Outdated WordPress Installations

**The Problem:** Over 60% of South African small business websites run on WordPress, but many are running outdated versions with known vulnerabilities.

**The Risk:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to:

- Inject malicious code
- Steal customer data
- Deface your website
- Use your server for cryptocurrency mining

**The Fix:**

- Enable automatic updates for WordPress core
- Keep all plugins and themes updated
- Remove unused plugins immediately
- Use a security plugin like Wordfence or Sucuri

## 2. Weak Authentication & Password Policies

**The Problem:** I regularly find admin panels with:

- Default credentials (admin/admin)
- No two-factor authentication
- Weak password requirements
- No account lockout after failed attempts

**The Risk:** Brute force attacks can compromise your entire system in hours.

**The Fix:**

- Implement 2FA for all admin accounts
- Enforce strong password policies (12+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- Add account lockout after 5 failed attempts
- Use a password manager for your team

## 3. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities

**The Problem:** Many custom-built South African e-commerce sites don't properly sanitize user inputs, leaving them vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**The Risk:** Attackers can:

- Extract your entire database (customer info, passwords, credit cards)
- Modify or delete data
- Gain administrative access

**The Fix:**

- Use parameterized queries/prepared statements
- Implement input validation on both client and server side
- Use an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework
- Regular security code reviews

## 4. Missing HTTPS/SSL Certificates

**The Problem:** Surprisingly, some South African business websites still run on HTTP without SSL encryption.

**The Risk:**

- Customer data transmitted in plain text
- Man-in-the-middle attacks
- Google penalizes your SEO ranking
- Loss of customer trust

**The Fix:**

- Get a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt
- Force HTTPS redirect for all traffic
- Update all internal links to HTTPS
- Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)

## 5. Exposed Sensitive Information

**The Problem:** I often find:

- Database credentials in public GitHub repos
- API keys in client-side JavaScript
- Detailed error messages revealing system info
- Unprotected admin panels (/admin, /wp-admin)

**The Risk:** Attackers can use this information to plan targeted attacks.

**The Fix:**

- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Never commit credentials to version control
- Implement custom error pages
- Restrict admin panel access by IP
- Use .gitignore properly

## Why This Matters for South African Businesses

With POPIA (Protection of Personal Information Act) now in effect, South African businesses face serious legal consequences for data breaches. A single security incident can result in:

- Fines up to R10 million
- Loss of customer trust
- Damage to brand reputation
- Legal liability

## What You Can Do Today

1. **Run a basic security audit** - Use free tools like:

   - OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning
   - SSL Labs to test your HTTPS configuration
   - Have I Been Pwned to check if your emails are compromised

2. **Update everything** - WordPress, plugins, themes, server software

3. **Implement 2FA** - Start with your most critical accounts

4. **Get a professional penetration test** - Identify vulnerabilities before attackers do
